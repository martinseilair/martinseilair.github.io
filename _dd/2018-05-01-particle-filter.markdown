Introductionsdd to basic probability distributions are often more confusing than actually helping. Many definitions seem randomly and are not properly justified. If there is additionally a lack of visual representation, many times learning will become meotizing instead of understanding.
In this series I try to give a visual approach to some basic proabability distributions.

In this first post I want to take a closer look at the Bernoulli distribution.

<h1> Definition </h1>

The Bernoulli distribution is most of the time defined as

$$ \mathrm{Bernoulli}(x|\mu) = \mu^x(1-\mu)^{1-x}, $$

where \\(x \in \\{0,1\\}\\) and \\(\mu \in \[0,1]\\\).

At a first glance this looks very random and in some sense it also is.
